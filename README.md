# ConvMDBlog

A Syntax Awareness Markdown Blog Converter.

It's basically manually hard coded script, just like python. However, it has more efficient code writing for modern language design and static strong type hint. 

## Usage

Just cargo run

```bash
cargo run -- ~/coding/blog/blog-draft/published ~/coding/blog/myjekyllblog/_posts d j
```

or Install

```bash
cargo install --path .
convmdblog ~/coding/blog/blog-draft/published ~/coding/blog/myjekyllblog/_posts d j
```
